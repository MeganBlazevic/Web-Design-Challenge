# Web-Design-Challenge

This challenge involved us using our WeatherPy data (or the data set that was provided to us). 
We were then asked to use HTML and CSS to create a dashboard to do an analysis for weather compared to latitude.

### Personal Reflection
This was a harder one for me.  At first glance, I didn't anticipate it being to hard...but then multiple challenges; different bootstrap variations, caused challenges.
I started off using a different bootstrap version; and ended up adjusting to a previous version, so I could get the components to work as I was anticipating. The GitHub IO was also a bit tricky as during class I couldn't ever get it to work properly. Learned that I needed to add an extra file path.
